# CVE-2012-0056

Introducing Mempodipper, an exploit for CVE-2012-0056. /proc/pid/mem is an interface for reading and writing, directly, process memory by seeking around with the same addresses as the process's virtual memory space. In 2.6.39, the protections against unauthorized access to /proc/pid/mem were deemed sufficient, and so the prior #ifdef that prevented write support for writing to arbitrary process memory was removed. Anyone with the correct permissions could write to process memory. It
turns out, of course, that the permissions checking was done poorly. This means that all Linux kernels >=2.6.39 are vulnerable, up until the fix commit for it a couple days ago. Let's take the old kernel code step by step and learn what's the matter with it.
